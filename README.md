# QuantumDensityVis

This project visualizes the 2p orbital of a hydrogen atom using the Schr√∂dinger equation, spherical harmonics and probability densities. The code is written in Python and shows how the orbital evolves over time.

## Structure
- `versionEN`: English version of the code and documentation
- `versionDE`: German version of the code and documentation

## Preview
Here is a preview of the 3D visualization of the 2p orbital:
